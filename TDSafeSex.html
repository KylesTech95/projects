<p>Hello! Welcome to my Technical Document about safer sex practices for non-traditional sexual behavior. Yep, that's right...Non-traditional.</p>
<p>I am fully aware that safe sex relates to all genders and types, but as a gay male myself, I intend for this page to reach out to those who are curious or currently exposed to unique sexual behavior such as:<ul>
    <code>
    Anal intercourse, Fisting, Licking & biting, Oral sex, Foreplay, Sounding,
    Sadism, etc..
    </code>
</article>

<section class="main-section" id="Safe_Sex">
<header>Safe Sex</header>
<article>
<p>In a "nutt" shell ;-), safe sex is performed when one or multiple parties take precaution to shield themselves from Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).</p>
<p>But wait...THERE'S MORE! Safe sex can also be demonstrated by:
    <code>
<ul>
    <li>Wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</li>
    <li>Taking prescribed medication</li>
    <li>Cleaning certain areas "thoroughly".</li>
    
</ul>
    </code>
    Let's "SLIDE" right into it, shall we?!

<section class="main-section" id="Condoms">
<header>Condoms</header>
<article>
<p>Condoms not only aid in the prevention of pregnancy, but they do help fight against STDs.</p>
<p>Look, we get it. Condoms do not always feel like the real thing, but it is a great 1st defense against diseases such as herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and much more. Just like my Marine Corps Seniors always say..."Wrap it before you tap it!"</p>
<p>Condoms can be obtained at your local grocery store, gas station, bathhouse, or even a circuit party.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Gloves">
<header>Gloves</header>
<article>
<p>You're probably wondering why "Gloves" is on the list for safer sex practices. Ill tell you why...Fisting.</p>
<p>Fisting is a sexual practice where one party inserts their fist inside of a rectum. From what I have researched, it seems that this practice requires a lot of time and patience. With that being said, for those of you who may be interested in this, i highly recommend that you do not go full FORCE your first go around.</p>
<p>Gloves can help prevent the burning sensation from hairy hands. In addition gloves can protect both parties from potential STDs especialy if the pitcher has cuts on their hands.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="PrEP">
<header>PrEP</header>
<article>
<p>PrEP, or Pre-Exposure Prohylaxis, is a medicine that is meant to prevent the contraction of HIV.This is meant for those who are HIV- and are at risk.</p>
<p>This isn't only for sexual encounters when doing it raw. You can use it on the daily if you are possibly sharing needles with someone, kissing someone with a cut in their mouth, absorbing blood at an establishment, injection...The list goes on.</p>

<article>
<p>Finally! the last topic of safe sex practices. If you have made it this far then you are either highly entertained by this Technical Document or you are taking your sexual health a lot more seriously...or BOTH!</p>
<p>Now let's get into "Douching" XD. Douching is performed when one rinses their buttox of waste before having sex. Yeah I know that you can douche vaginas as well, but the reason why I mentioned only the buttox is for the fact that brown stuff is involved.
</p>
    <code>If you do not clean in full, you are leaving room for bacterial spread and possible infection. </code>
I hope that this made you more aware. If you do not clean and the sex doesn't get muddy, then you may be one of those ones who are naturally clean like ALL the time...which means you have an outstanding diet. You go!</p>

<p>
    In conclusion, thank you for taking the time to educate yourself on safer non-traditional sex practices. I am more than confident that you may think about your safety in regards to sexual activity.
